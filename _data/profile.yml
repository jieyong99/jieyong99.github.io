  <p>
    Hi! My name is Jieyong Kim, an M.S. student at the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence, Yonsei University.  I am advised by Prof. <a href="https://donalee.github.io/">Dongha Lee</a> in the <a href="https://diyonsei.notion.site/">Data & Language Intelligence Lab</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
     My research explores how to extract meaningful insights from data and maximize their utility through the integration of AI. I am particularly interested in adapting and personalizing large language models (LLMs) to build systems that can effectively operate in real-world scenarios. By aligning AI behavior with user intent and contextual needs, my work aims to make AI systems more practical, adaptive, and impactful in everyday applications.
